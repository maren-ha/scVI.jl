# scVI.jl

![](../../logo/scvi-julia-logo.jpg)

A Julia package for fitting VAEs to single-cell data using count distributions. 
Based on the Python implementation in the [`scvi-tools`](https://github.com/scverse/scvi-tools) package. 

## Overview

The scVI model was first proposed in [Lopez R, Regier J, Cole MB *et al.* Deep generative modeling for single-cell transcriptomics. *Nat Methods* **15**, 1053-1058 (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-018-0229-2). 

More on the much more extensive Python package ecosystem [`scvi-tools`](https://github.com/scverse/scvi-tools) can be found on the 
[website](https://scvi-tools.org) and in the corresponding paper [Gayoso A, Lopez R, Xing G. *et al.* A Python library for probabilistic analysis of single-cell omics data. *Nat Biotechnol* **40**, 163â€“166 (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-021-01206-w). 

This is the documentation for the Julia version implementing basic functionality, including the following (non-exhausive list): 

- standard and linearly decoded VAE models 
- support for negative binomial generative distribution with and without zero-inflation 
- different ways of specifying the dispersion parameter 
- store data in a (very basic) Julia version of the Python [`AnnData`](https://anndata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) objects 
- several built-in datasets 
- training routines supporting a wide range of customisable hyperparameters 

## Installation

The package can be downloaded from the [Github repo](https://github.com/maren-ha/scVI.jl) and added with the Julia package manager via 

```
julia> ]add "https://github.com/maren-ha/scVI.jl"
```

or alternatively by 

```
julia> using Pkg; Pkg.add("https://github.com/maren-ha/scVI.jl")
```
